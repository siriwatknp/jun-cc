## Locations

Create a demo page to `docs/src/pages/playground/` or `docs/src/pages/experiments/` based on the type.

## Post Task

Call out the URL to view the playground or experiment you just created/updated.

For example:

> URL: http://localhost:{{port}}/playground/{{demo-name}}

The `{{port}}` is the dev server port (usually `3000` or `3001`) depending on the project.
